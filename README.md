Phore Core integration/staging repository
=====================================

Phore is a cutting edge cryptocurrency, with many features not available in most other cryptocurrencies.
- Anonymized transactions using zerocoin technology.
- Fast transactions featuring guaranteed zero confirmation transactions, we call it _SwiftTX_.
- Masternode technology used to secure the network and provide the above features, each Masternode is secured
  with collateral of 10K PHR

17.6M phore was produced for swapping. 500k were mined 1-200 blocks to bring that amount to 18.1M PHR, the amount needed for the swap.

_Unfortunately, the code was not originally properly forked on GitHub from the PIVX repository. This serves the same purpose. We forked from [PIVX-Project/PIVX](https://github.com/PIVX-Project/PIVX/)._

Since then, the Phore repository has been rebaselined to show the fork relationship properly.
